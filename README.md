How our project works:

The main page includes "Upload Profile", "Search", and "Show Yearbook" options. Show Yearbook simply displays all the profiles of every entry in the database,
in their entirety. The Upload profile page allows a user to submit a picture, name, major, and short bio combination, which will be put into the database. To 
access any indvidual's personal page, use the search page. Anyone in the database with the entered name will show up, with their picture and name. Click on a 
picture of anyone from this page to get their full profile in a pop-up overlay.


Issues with our project:

When uploading a picture for your profile in the "Login" page, you have to click "Choose Image" and select your picture from your files, then click "Choose Image" again for your picture to show up. 
We couldn't figure out how to solve this problem.

Our search by name feature is case sensitive and will search for exactly the name that was added to the "Upload Profile" page. For example, if the name "John Doe" was added, 
the search will not bring up anything if just "John" or just "Doe" is searched for. Also, our search page can display a max of 10 profiles at a time.

Refreshing a page other than the start page doesn't work, so to accomplish this, navigate back to the main page and then return to whatever page desired to be refreshed.
Similarly, attempting to navigate to one of the other pages by typing in the search bar also doesn't work, they must be accessed by the links.

Since the HOMEPAGE button is a react link, it always starts out colored white, meaning it won't be visible on the Show Yearbook page at first.
